#### Introduction 

- **Malware Persistence:** Malware employs various techniques to evade detection.
- **Proactive Hunting:** It is essential to use multiple tools and techniques to actively hunt for malware, which may hide in plain sight, inject into other processes, reside in files, email attachments, or exist as fileless malware in memory.

#### Detection Tools

- **Tool Variety:** A wide range of tools is necessary to detect different types of malware signatures, including Meterpreter sessions and DLL injections.
- **PE Capture Tool:** An example tool, NoVirusThanks’s PE Capture, captures PE files, executables, DLLs, and drivers loaded into the OS for analysis.
- **ProcScan.rb:** Scans process memory for code injections, working for 32-bit systems/applications.
- **Meterpreter Payload Detection:** Scans running processes to detect Meterpreter.
- **Reflective Injection Detection:** Detects reflective DLL injections by looking for PE headers.

#### Detection Techniques

- **Static and Dynamic Analysis:** Techniques for both static and dynamic analysis are crucial to detect malware. Static analysis involves examining the malware file without executing it, while dynamic analysis involves executing the malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior.

#### Memory Analysis

- **Importance:** Traditional file-system detection techniques are often unreliable for memory-resident malware, making memory analysis vital.
- **Memory Forensics:** Provides visibility into the runtime state of a system, revealing running processes, open network connections, and recently executed commands.
- **Acquisition Methods:** Memory can be acquired via hardware (more resilient to rootkit modification) or software (requires kernel mode access and may overwrite evidence).
- **Memory Analysis Tools:**
    - **Mandiant’s (FireEye) Redline:** Provides host investigative capabilities for finding signs of malicious activity through memory and file analysis.
    - **Volatility:** Memory forensics tool for analyzing memory dumps.
    - **Get-InjectedThreat.ps1:** PowerShell script for memory analysis.
    - **Memdump:** Utility for creating memory dumps for analysis.

####  Malware Analysis

- **Skill Necessity:** Basic malware analysis skills are essential for threat hunters, even if they are not dedicated malware analysts.
- **Binary Analysis:** To understand malware further, analysis of binaries in clear-text in memory is needed.
