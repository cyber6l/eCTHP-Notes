1. **Introduction**
    
    - Event logs, initially used for troubleshooting, have become vital for incident response and threat hunting.
2. **Windows Event Logs**
    
    - Core event logs in Windows include Application, System, and Security logs.
    - Logs capture various events such as application errors, system processes, and security-related actions.
    - Modern Windows versions use the EVTX format for logs.
    - Additional logs include Setup, Forwarded Events, and Applications and Services logs.
3. **Windows Event IDs**
    
    - Specific event IDs are crucial for monitoring account logon events, account management, and logon types.
    - Examples of important event IDs include:
        - 4624: Successful logon
    
- 4625: Failed logon
- 4634: Successful logoff
- 4647: User-initiated logoff
- 4648: Logon using explicit credentials
- 4672: Special privileges assigned
- 4720: Account created
- 4768: Kerberos ticket (TGT) requested
- 4769: Kerberos service ticket requested
- 4771: Kerberos pre-authentication failed
- 4776: Attempted to validate credentials
- 4778: Session reconnected
- 4779: Session disconnected
- 4724: An attempt was made to reset an account's password
- 4738: A user account was changed
- 4740: A user account was locked out
- 4765: SID History was added to an account
- 4766: An attempt to add SID History to an account failed
    - Logon types provide context on how an account logged in, such as interactive, network, or service logons
	 
|Logon Type|Logon Title|Description|
|---|---|---|
|2|Interactive|Physically logged on.|
|3|Network|Logged on from the network.|
|4|Batch|For batch servers/scheduled tasks.|
|5|Service|Service started by Service Control Manager.|
|7|Unlock|Workstation unlocked.|
|8|NetworkCleartext|Network credentials sent in cleartext.|
|9|NewCredentials|Cloned token with new credentials.|
|10|RemoteInteractive|Logged on via Terminal Services or RDP.|
|11|CachedInteractive|Logged on with locally stored credentials.|
Logon IDs help track session information across different events.

    - Discusses centralizing logs from multiple machines for better monitoring and analysis.
5. **Windows Log Rotation & Clearing**
    
    - Methods and best practices for managing log sizes and retention.
6. **Tools**
    
    - Lists and explains various tools used for log analysis and event monitoring.
7. **Advanced Hunting**
    
    - Techniques for developing custom hunting dashboards and detecting both generic and advanced attacks.
